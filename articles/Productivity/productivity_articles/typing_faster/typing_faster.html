    <p>Go on <a class="paragraphLink" href="https://monkeytype.com/">this</a> website right now and start typing; write down your score somewhere you will be able to find back in a few weeks/months.</p>

    <p>Most of us use computers and therefore keyboards on a daily basis. The thing is that also most of us are very slow at using them... <br>
      In some cases, schools teach their students how to type correctly and fast, but this doesn't happen often. <br>
      If your score is below 50WPM, you are probably not using the correct technique. But don't worry, you can learn how to ! I recommend you to use <a class="paragraphLink" href="https://www.typing.com/">this</a> website. It will teach you how to type the keys with the appropriate fingers in an interactive way. Once you think you adopted the write habits, you can move to monkeytype. <br>What I found interesting with monkeytype is that you can type custom text, so I usually pick some text from an ebook and type it. This allows me to read interesting stuff while getting better at typing.

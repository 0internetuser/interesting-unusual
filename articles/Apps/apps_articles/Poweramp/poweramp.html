    <p>Poweramp - The (real) ultimate music app</p>
  </div>

    <p><a class="paragraphLink" href="https://powerampapp.com/" target="_blank">Poweramp</a> is a very powerful, higly customizable and feature-rich music player for android.</p>

    <p> Here are (in my opinion) the key highlights of this wonderful app :</p>

    <div style="margin-top:20px;"></div>

    <ul class="justifiedList">
      <li>Very smooth and fluid interface</li>
      <li>Handles playlists (.m3u files) very well when associated with audio files on SD cards (which often breaks after reboots on most apps) as well as on internal storage</li>
      <li>Amazing equalizer with good presets (it even feels like the audio quality gets upgraded)</li>
      <li>Wave-form progress bar (very convenient to localize drops)</li>
      <li>Adding artwork to the files missing one</li>
      <li>Very wide range of deep settings</li>
      <li>Many different layouts and themes</li>
    </ul>

    <div style="margin-top:20px;"></div>

    <p class="mainText">Even though it's a paid app (5â‚¬, which is defenitely cheap) and not open source, it doesn't include any tracker (see the <a class="paragraphLink" href="https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.maxmpz.audioplayer/latest/" target="_blank">exodus report</a>) and can be downloaded (officially) outside of google's PlayStore. Also note that the app is very light (<25MB) and doesn't require a good chip to run smoothly.</p>

      <img src="settings.gif" width="200px" alt="">
    </div>

    <p class="imageCaption">Some animations and settings within the app (laggy because it's low frame gifs)</p>

    <div style="margin-top:30px;"></div>

    <p class="mainText">You can get a test version of the app (the full app but only temporarily) for 2 weeks. It might feel a bit confusing at first but I can guarantee you that you will love it after understanding the logic behind the navigations and play orders.</p>
